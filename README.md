# Nuclear-Sensor-BlockChain
Nuclear power plants play a key role in the transition to renewable clean energy, but since nuclear powerplants are administered and controlled by a central authority, public trust and transparency are lacking. Currently, most nuclear plants rely on centralized systems to manage sensor data for things such as temperature, radiation, pressure, power output, and other crucial information. This centralized approach limits public access to real-time operational data, but without open verifiable data, a barrier is created between public acceptance and the widespread adoption of nuclear energy as a clean power source. Additionally, a centralized system for generating, processing, and storing data creates a single point of failure that can be vulnerable to manipulation or faults of mutability. Malicious intent or simply human error can corrupt extremely sensitive data that is responsible for safely handling nuclear operations. When it comes to clean energy, accountability, transparency, and safety are essential.
In a vulnerable system like a nuclear plant, securing transparent operational data is vital. Blockchain offers a compelling solution by decentralizing control and making data tamper resistant. Instead of relying on a single authority to manage sensor readings, a blockchain based system would distribute access across a network, making it much harder for a malicious individual to alter information. Given blockchains immutability, this makes it ideal for storing critical metrics output by sensors, especially in environments where small errors can have serious consequences. A hybrid blockchain-based approach would be optimal for nuclear data storage, because by combining transparency of public blockchains with the speed and access permissions of private blockchains, there is a balance between transparency and security. This allows for nuclear plant data to be protected within a private layer while fundamental performance measures are shared publicly, granting the public an ability to view various performative data, aiding in acceptance and transparency within nuclear powerplants. To further enhance control, regulatory smart contracts can be implemented to automatically respond to abnormalities, such as temperature or radiation readings exceeding the safe threshold.  In summary, a hybrid blockchain based system would ensure that essential information remains secure, and accessible without compromising the integrity of the plant or its operations.
